    <h1>About us</h1> 
    
    <div class="column two">
      <p>The foundation for Mantra Medical Limited was a simple question: <em class="notice">Why aren't blood pressure cuffs and stethoscopes cleaned between every patient?</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="column two">          
      <p>Realising that existing methods of cleaning were far too time consuming for consistent use, a market opportunity for an innovative, faster and easier method was spotted. Through examining other opportunities within the clinical environment the product portfolio was expanded and developed into its present form.</p>
        
      <p>We have established strong commercial partnerships with designers, IP specialists and the Medipex NHS Innovation hub for Yorkshire, as well as good links with healthcare staff in Yorkshire and beyond.</p>

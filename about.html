          <div class="column two">
            <p>The foundation for Mantra Medical Limited was a simple question: <em class="notice">Why aren't blood pressure cuffs and stethoscopes cleaned between every patient?</em></p>
                        <p>Realising that existing methods of cleaning were far too time consuming for consistent use, a market opportunity for an innovative, faster and easier method was spotted. Through examining other opportunities within the clinical environment the product portfolio was expanded and developed into its present form.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="column two">          
            <p><a href="#board">Our Board</a> comprises a medically trained Managing Director with wide-ranging clinical experience supported by Directors with significant commercial expertise, as well as experience in senior NHS management, financial services, risk management, general management, recruitment, and user experience design.</p>
                        <p>We have established strong commercial partnerships with designers, IP specialists and the Medipex NHS Innovation hub for Yorkshire, as well as good links with healthcare staff in Yorkshire and beyond.</p>

            <p class="notice">Mantra Medical was formed in 2009 by Dr Paul Hercock. Success in the medical market requires not only great products and medical expertise but also business acumen, detailed knowledge of NHS procurement streams, and strategic management thinking.</p>
            
            <p>To this end, the Mantra Medical board also includes Neil MacDonald, Tony Hercock and Richard Jones.</p>
            
            <p>We therefore have a very well balanced and experienced team and are all set to accomplish our goals. We aspire not only to commercial success - through our products we aim to genuinely improve the healthcare environment forever, both in the NHS and internationally. We aim to make hospitals safer for patients, better for staff, and more cost-effective for management. We have very high ambitions and will settle for absolutely nothing less.</p>

          <h1>Quality Management</h1>
          
          <div class="column two">
            <p>All our products are developed within a quality assurance framework based around ISO 13485. We are preparing for an initial compliance audit to be conducted by DNV Certification. All our design partners are ISO 9001 registered, and our principal design partner is working towards ISO 13485. A copy of our quality assurance manual is available on our website.</p>
            <p>We are fully aware of our commitments under the Medical Devices Directive, and the main requirement to be met during design is to ensure that quality and safety of all devices is prioritised.</p>
                        <p>Our approach to quality is further demonstrated by us having already invested in proof of concept work for the cuff cleaner project with the microbiology department at Sheffield University.</p>
            
            <p>The overall responsibility for quality assurance falls to the Director for Management Systems and QA, who is answerable to the board. The reporting, resolution and documentation procedure for adverse events is defined in our ISO 13485-based quality system, and risk management is an agenda item at every board meeting.</p>

            <h2>Why is cleaning blood pressure cuffs a problem?</h2>
            <p>Blood pressure cuffs are recognised as important vectors of HCAI spread<sup><a href="/evidence">1-5</a></sup>.<br />
              The World Health Organisation's <a href="https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/en/">Saves Lives</a> report stated that:</p>

                <h3>What is a blood pressure cuff?</h3>
                <p>The blood pressure cuff is one of the most common pieces of medical equipment in the world and is considered standard equipment for almost all secondary care patient interactions.</p>
                <p>Because the blood pressure cuff measures blood pressure, it is a particularly important diagnostic and monitoring tool. Nearly all patients in secondary care will be exposed to this device at some stage during their stay, often multiple times per day.</p>

                <h3>Why is there a problem?</h3>
                <p>Blood pressure cuffs are proven to spread infectious agents. The blood pressure cuff is placed onto the patient's arm in close proximity to the axilla and antecubital fossa, both of which are body areas that are naturally heavily colonised by bacteria. Cleaning blood pressure cuffs manually is difficult because they have a large surface area covered in large part with hook-and-loop material, within which debris often builds up over time.</p>
                <p>Important pathogens spread via this route include coronavirus, norovirus, rotavirus, C.difficile, MRSA, E.coli, and others. A World Health Organisation's report for the <a href="https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/en/">Saves Lives: Clean Your Hands</a> initiative (to which 26,875 hospitals are signatories) stated that HCAI spread <em>&quot;&hellip;occurs mostly via health-care workers' contaminated hands, <b>contaminated items/equipment</b>, and environment.&quot;</em></p>

                <h3>Why don't existing cleaning methods work?</h3>
                <p>Although best practice already requires cleaning after each use, existing methods are unsuited to the modern healthcare environment because they require healthcare staff to act outside existing workflow. Any task that is in addition to the basic provision of care can only be done in the quietest times and therefore cannot possibly be done consistently.</p>
                <p>The limitations of existing methods mean that the cleaning of blood pressure cuffs is currently performed only sporadically, if at all. A better solution that works with healthcare staff is much needed.</p>

              <h3>Do nothing</h3>
              <p>Despite the evidence that contaminated blood pressure cuffs spread infection, many providers currently do not have an established cleaning program. This would seem to be a direct reflection of the unsuitability of present methods. <b>The 'do nothing' approach has a very real and direct cost, both financial and clinical.</b></p>
            </li>
            <li class="col col-4 four pop">
              <h3>Manual cleaning</h3>
              <p>Manual cleaning with swabs is <b>highly laborious, time-consuming, and impossible to ensure consistency</b> due to the hook-and-loop material covering much of the surface. There is no way to ensure consistency from one clean to the next. Manual cleaning is readily neglected by overworked staff. A healthcare worker may need to clean a blood pressure cuff upwards of fifty times per day.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="col col-4 four">
              <h3>Disposables / single-use</h3>
              <p>While single-use disposables provide an effective solution, they are <b>expensive and environmentally unsound</b>, require a flawless supply chain, and are reliant upon staff remembering to replace them. In many cases, staff in busy areas take 'short-cuts' into reusing them rather than seeking a replacement from storage.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="conclusion">Existing methods are unsuited to the modern healthcare environment. A better solution is required that works with healthcare staff, rather than against them.</p>

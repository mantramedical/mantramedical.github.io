    <h1>Investment</h1>
              
    <div class="column two">
      <p class="notice">We are now seeking investment to develop our existing prototypes and concepts into definitive prototypes that are ready for market.</p>
      
      <p>Developing products for the medical market is a long journey – especially if, like us, you strive for the very highest standard – but the potential rewards are substantial. Although Mantra Medical is still pre-market we strongly believe that our product portfolio, medical and commercial experience, partnerships and commitment to quality mean that with the right investment partner we are all set for success.</p>
    </div>
              
    <div class="column two">
      <p>Manufacturing medical devices is complex, time consuming and expensive. There is no room for compromise in quality. As a highly regulated industry sector there is a legislative requirement that devices are manufactured to the highest standards of safety, and due to the competitive nature of the market any device must have very clear and well developed Unique Selling Points (USPs) to achieve success. Ensuring that the project is adequately funded is a key step in planning development and turning our vision into reality.</p>

    <h1>Why is investment needed?</h1>
         
    <div class="column two">
      <h2>Development</h2>
      <p>The majority of our expenditure is development cost. We work with a professional design partner (Fripp Design Limited) who have experience in the medical sector and a proven record of developing production-ready prototypes of the highest quality. They are ISO 9001 registered and are shifting their focus from general design work to concentrate primarily on the medical sector.</p>
      
      <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>Having identified true niches in the market it is absolutely essential to protect our ideas in the most robust manner possible. Most of our concepts are subject to an international patent application completed in conjunction with a top patent attorney from Withers &amp; Rogers LLP.</p>
      
      <p>As the IP application process proceeds further expenditure will be necessary to finalise the application in domestic territories of commercial interest around the world, and it will also be necessary to pay maintenance fees to ensure that our intellectual protection does not lapse.</p>
    </div>
 
    <div class="column two">
      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <p>It is necessary to test all medical devices for clinical effectiveness, usability, and regulatory compliance prior to marketing. This encompasses both the cost of the testing itself and that of any re-design required in accordance with the results. We are very fortunate that a major hospital in Yorkshire has expressed an interest in performing clinical trials on our blood pressure cuff device without charge, but the cost of compliance testing and clinical testing of the other devices must still be met.</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>We have great faith in our ideas, and are completely confident that through our design partner and with our expertise we will produce devices of the very highest standard. As set out in the following Financial Plan, the potential financial rewards for an investor are large but it is integral to the development process that the design phase is both cash intensive and time consuming.</p>
      
      <p>We are seeking an investment partner who shares our vision for revolutionising common aspects of medical care, who sees the potential for our ideas, and who will support the development process through its various phases as we strive for products of the very highest quality.</p>

    <h1>Financial Plan</h1>

    <div class="column two">
      <p>We possess medical, IT and business expertise but do not have integral product design experience therefore all design work is contracted to a professional design partner. Similarly it is intended that all future manufacturing work will be sub-contracted.</p>
      
      <p>The present four Directors and single Associate Director will receive no remuneration for work done during the R&amp;D phases. We also have a Clerk to the board who supports the work of the Directors, again without remuneration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="column two">
      <p>Therefore we presently have no employees, salary commitments, labour costs or overheads and no directly consumed materials. The overwhelming majority of required finance is for design sub-contracting work with the balance being used for intellectual property expenses, marketing, compliance testing and legal costs.</p>

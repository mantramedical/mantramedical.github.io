          <h1 class="divide">The coronavirus outbreak and challenges for hospital infection control</h1>
          <p>Since news emerged in December 2019 of an outbreak of a novel coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China, concern amongst the international healthcare community has understandably been rising.</p>
          <p>It is a novel coronavirus that causes the condition Covid-19, characterised by a dry cough, high fever and difficulty breathing. Concerns stem not only from its ability to cause severe respiratory distress, but also the absence of a direct treatment, lack of a vaccine, and an apparent R0 of between 2 and 3 (in other words, on average, each infected person will infect 2-3 others). This outbreak has the ingredients of a major global pandemic and attention must turn to prevention wherever possible.</p>
          <p>Because the virus is novel and coronavirus infections in humans are comparatively rare, the underlying immunity in the population is virtually non-existent. For this reason and many others, this is much more than "just the flu". Evidence emerging from China, Italy and Iran &mdash; the countries worst affected so far &mdash; shows that the condition can produce very serious respiratory distress, especially in those with underlying health conditions. The disease threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems as caseload grows and our very way of life is under threat.</p>
          <p>The novel coronavirus spreads predominantly in two ways:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Through air</b> - mostly inhalation of viral particles expelled from an individual who is shedding the virus</li>
            <li><b>Through contaminated surfaces</b> &mdash; viral particles stick to hands following contact with a virus-hosting surface, and hands are then brought into contact with the nose, mouth or eyes.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Social distancing measures are part of the strategy to limit spread through airborne transmission and handwashing advice seeks to address other routes, but in the context of hospital care we believe that additional measures will be necessary.</p>
          <p>Perhaps one of the most important challenges that hospitals will face is also one of the most forgotten about. No matter how many coronavirus patients need hospital care, there will be no let up in the rate of other serious health conditions unrelated to the virus. Although elective surgery is sure to be cancelled as more and more facilities are needed to care for Covid-19 patients, there will still be patients with myocardial infarction, oncological disorders, renal problems, gastrointestinal disorders, and so on. Not only will this further strain the system, but hospitals must also consider how to avoid spreading the virus to patients attending for other reasons.</p>
          <p>One obvious strategy is segregation, ensuring that 'red zones' dedicated to management of Covid-19 are separated from other clinical areas. But the circulation of staff, visitors and supplies means that, almost inevitably, there is a risk of viral infections spreading to other areas.</p>
          <p>In our view, a major focus must be on ensuring good basic clinical hygiene. Every surface that contacts any patient for any reason must be scrupulously clean. Basic clinical tools such as pulse oximeters and blood pressure cuffs must be decontaminated between every patient to prevent them from acting as a vector of infection spread. A global pandemic produces a perfect storm for infection transmission: as the workload burden on healthcare staff increases to unsustainable levels, the opportunities to perform routine cleaning diminish. And yet, infection control activities are more critical than ever.</p>
          <p>Innovation is the key weapon. New ideas are required that can deliver consistent cleaning with no extra burden on staff. In the meantime we urge healthcare providers to focus on basic clinical hygiene and to not underestimate the possibility of incidental spread of coronavirus via contaminated hospital surfaces.

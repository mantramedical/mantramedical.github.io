          <p>As the coronavirus pandemic begins to reveal itself as a global disaster, attention turns to what else we can do to slow the spread of the contagion.</p>
          <p>Much of mainland Europe is currently in a state of enforced lockdown and social distancing measures are underway across much of the world. At the same time, however, hospitals are filling up and the risk of infection spread amongst the vulnerable becomes higher with every passing day.</p>
          <p>We have previously written about the dangers of overlooking the needs of non-coronavirus patients caught up incidentally in the crisis. With the level of media interest focused on the outbreak, it is easy to forget that patients suffering with all other healthcare problems continue to arrive in hospital, day after day. It has always been imperative that we prevent the spread of healthcare associated infection to and between these patients; this is now more important than ever before.</p>
          <p>At Mantra Medical, we face a dilemma. We are a small, pre-market company that is developing devices to reduce the risk of infection transmission caused by routine patient interactions. Pulse oximeters and blood pressure cuffs are used on every hospital patient in the world. Existing systems and methods for infection prevention make it extremely difficult to deliver consistent and effective cleaning of these devices, meaning they act as a source of infection spread as they move from patient to patient. It is our belief that the unique, automated products we have developed can provide consistent cleaning in a system already under massive pressure. All hospital patients could benefit from these products, and others like them, that are being made ready for use in the real world. We want to help make a difference. However, although our products are designed and almost ready to go, we do not yet have regulatory approval for our devices.</p>
          <p>Under normal circumstances it would take us a year to gain the required approvals. This will be far too late to help in the fight against coronavirus. We feel that our devices are needed immediately. Therefore, after much reflection, we have taken the exceptional step of writing to the governing body in the UK &mdash; the MHRA &mdash; to request that a special measure be brought into play to allow our devices to be made available to patients without waiting a year for normal regulatory procedures. Called Article 59 MDR, this provision allows for derogation (a bypassing) from normal conformity assessment procedures in times of a public health emergency. Sensibly, <a href="https://www.hilldickinson.com/insights/articles/covid-19-new-mhra-guidance-and-processes" target="_blank">the MHRA has indicated</a> that they recognise the need for derogation in the present circumstances and are open to approving the limited use of some non-CE marked devices. We await their decision on our devices.</p>
          <p>We remain absolutely committed to the safety and performance of our medical devices. We do not seek Article 59 approval in order to derogate from our safety obligations in any way. Rather, we seek approval to derogate from a bureaucratic process that is designed to keep patients safe, but that has the potential in the current circumstances to cause delays that patients can ill-afford.</p>
          <p><a href="/innovations/">More information about our devices</a> can be found on our website. If you believe that these devices should be available to patients now, please write to your MP, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, and to the MHRA to express your support.</p>
          <p><a href="/assets/downloads/article_59_derogation-mantra_medical_ltd.pdf">I enclose a copy of the letter (PDF)</a> we have sent to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care.</p>
          <p>A sincere thank you for your support.</p>

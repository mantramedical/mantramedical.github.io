          <h1 class="divide">Medical device regulation and Covid-19 – Finding the balance</h1>
          <p>The Covid-19 pandemic means challenging times for everyone in healthcare. Exceptional measures are being taken to manage the intense challenges posed by the coronavirus outbreak. Whether you are on the medical frontline, supplying goods or manufacturing products, the way we all work is changing and we must all stand ready to make adaptations.</p>
          <p>The UK government has already taken the exceptional step of asking large manufacturers such as JCB and Unipart to switch manufacturing from car and vehicle parts to production of ventilators. The general public is being asked to reduce social contact to a minimum and the most susceptible in society are soon to be asked to protect themselves by self-isolating for as long as 12 weeks.</p>
          <p>In the midst of the chaos it is easy to overlook the basics. While it is a priority to ensure that life saving products are made available to staff and patients as quickly as possible, it is also vital that the safety and performance of these products is subject to the appropriate level of scrutiny. The medical device market is one of the most tightly regulated sectors in the world for good reason &mdash; unsafe or ineffective medical devices could cause far more problems than they solve. In May 2020, the new Medical Device Regulations (MDR) formally replace the MDD and bring forth a more stringent regulatory framework for all aspects of medical device development, production and surveillance.</p>
          <p>As with everything though, a balance is needed. Analogies to a war-time footing are being readily made and there is a growing acceptance that a sensible flexing of usual rules is required to meet the highly unusual demands of the present time. Bringing a new medical device to market normally requires that manufacturers navigate complex conformity assessment procedures that, with a current shortage of notified body capacity, can take over a year to work through. This is not only commercially problematic for the companies involved; if the devices in question stand to benefit patients in the light of the current public health emergency, it could be strongly argued that the regulatory processes, if too stringent, could have a net negative impact.</p>
          <p>The Medical Device Regulations (MDR) themselves acknowledge this. Article 59 MDR allows for emergency derogation from standard conformity assessment procedures in the event of a public health emergency. In other words, if the government (via their competent authority, the MHRA) feels that a device not yet in possession of a CE mark is crucial in addressing a public health emergency, they can allow normal procedures to be bypassed and make the device available to patients while they urgently need it.</p>
          <p>Medical device regulatory processes remain vital. As a pre-market company with developmental medical devices that have not yet passed through the conformity assessment process, Mantra Medical is absolutely committed to the requirements for medical device safety and performance mandated by the Medical Device Regulations. In our opinion, however, it is crucial that a sensible balance is reached. Appropriate compromises must be made to allow highly-relevant devices to avoid regulatory backlogs, ensuring that they reach staff and patients who need them urgently.</p>
          <p>We urge the government to consider applying Article 59 MDR where appropriate to meet the demands of the current crisis.</p>

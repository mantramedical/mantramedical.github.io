          <h1 class="divide">Workflow integration - disrupting a problem without disrupting people</h1>
          <p>Effective healthcare requires robust systems and processes that work to ensure efficiency even under stress conditions. Once established, healthcare processes produce entrenched workflow pathways that staff become familiar and comfortable with. Effective processes go some way to ensuring that key tasks are completed regardless of workload and help staff to know what to do and when to do it.</p>
          <p>Any new innovation that disrupts entrenched workflow is neither desirable nor likely to be adopted. Failure to consider existing workflow while designing products has been stated as <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/10/10-reasons-why-health-care-startups-fail/" target="_blank">one of the top-ten reasons for medical device startups failing</a>.</p>
          <p>Despite this, many medical devices fail to engineer deep workflow integration into their design. Too many new products focus on the perceived features and benefits rather than the ability of staff to use the device in practice. If a device requires a change in staff behaviour in order to gain any benefits available, it will not see widespread adoption and will fail to meet its objectives.</p>
          <p>It is important for all medical device manufacturers to remember that while <b>problems need disrupting, people do not</b>.</p>
          <p>Focusing on features and benefits while paying insufficient attention to workflow integration is a serious mistake. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2638/" target="_blank">As this paper by Carol Cain and Saira Haque suggests</a>, if insufficient attention is given to existing staff workflow while designing medical devices, staff are forced into a decision &mdash; either use the device at the expense of another task, or neglect the device and fail to take advantage of any benefits it could otherwise offer.</p>
          <p>Cain and Haque argue that a deep understanding of healthcare workflow processes is necessary to ensure that any additions to those processes are acceptable. Their first premise is that any failure of healthcare staff to complete a task is not necessarily down to the complexity of that individual process. Rather, in many cases it is the interaction of multiple processes that causes disruption. In the event of multiple processes interacting, even the simplest tasks can become impossible to complete:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>&hellip;when workflow processes are looked at in isolation, the processes appear quite logical (and even efficient) in acting to accomplish the end goal. It is in the interaction among the processes that complexities arise. Some of these interactions hide conflicts in the priorities&hellip;</p>
            <cite>
              <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2638/" target="_blank">Cain C, Haque S. Chapter 31: Organizational Workflow and Its Impact on Work Quality</a> <span>Patient Safety and Quality: An Evidence-Based Handbook for Nurses</span>
            </cite>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Many medical device manufacturers fall into the trap of analysing the complexity of using their devices in isolation. This is a mistake. To ensure seamless adoption of new devices, they must be simple to use even when multiple processes are interacting and should keep any disruption to the conduct of process workflow to an absolute minimum. Even simple tasks are neglected when workflow is disrupted and priorities conflict.</p>
          <p>Infection control is a great example of an important healthcare activity that can suffer from this effect. Basic clinical hygiene is performed readily during quiet times but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25278571" target="_blank">becomes increasingly difficult to undertake as workload increases.</a> If hygiene activities are considered only in isolation it is difficult to comprehend why routine cleaning of commonly-used clinical tools is ever neglected. For example, wiping down a pulse oximeter or blood pressure cuff after use with an antiseptic wipe takes only a few seconds and is known to be effective if performed. However, this viewpoint is far too simplistic and misses the effect of multiple interacting processes on staff capacity. Existing infection prevention methods do not adequately address this.</p>
          <p>Routine cleaning is highly susceptible to the phenomenon documented by Cain and Haque &mdash; despite apparent simplicity, it is difficult to accommodate into clinical care and exceptionally challenging to deliver during time-pressured acute situations (when, many would argue, it is needed most).</p>
          <p>The failure of existing infection prevention methods to integrate seamlessly into existing staff workflow underpins their failure to eradicate healthcare associated infections, and goes some way to explaining why HCAIs continue to cost the UK economy £1bn per year.</p>
          <p>A new approach is required that puts workflow integration at the forefront of product design, disrupting the problem without disrupting the people that work within it. At Mantra Medical, our infection control concepts are designed entirely around complete workflow integration. We believe that workflow integration combined with product automation will ensure universal compliance with infection control practice, leading to a safer and cleaner healthcare environment. <a href="/innovations/">Learn more about our infection control innovations</a> and how we will deliver safer healthcare.</p>
